## Features and How to Use:

Welcome to InHabit! A simple app that allows for users to conveniently track any sort of habit you're looking to work into your daily or weekly routine! Whether it's setting aside exercise time, or budgeting for study time, Habit Tracker is guaranteed to keep you on track!

This habit tracker features a fully functional user system where users can create an account, log in, and get started tracking your habits!

Once an account has been created, a user can begin to add habits. When habits are added they will display in a table to the left of the screen. Users can then click the square to interact with the corresponding habit on the corresponding date. When more habits have been added and completed, more insightful data will be given on the right of the screen. Users also have the ability to choose between three views: this calendar week, the past 7 days, and the past month.

Outside of the habit tracking, users can learn more about the app, learn more about its developers, view their profile, or update their information and credentials. These actions can be done through page navigation.

Happy Habit Tracking!
